# Convert Photo or Text to Simple 3D Model

This project is a prototype designed to convert either a **photo** or a **text prompt** into a **basic 3D model** (`.obj` or `.stl` format) using Python and open-source AI/ML tools.

> 💡 This is part of a selection round assignment to demonstrate 3D model generation using neural network-based pipelines.

## 📁 Contents

- `convertto3d.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code pipeline.
- `README.md`: Documentation for setup and usage.
- 'Input and Output': Sample input and output.

## 🧠 Features

- Accepts either an image or text prompt as input.
- Generates a simple 3D mesh as output.
- Utilizes AI-based generation techniques like NeRF or DreamFusion (planned or implemented).
- Supports exporting to `.obj` or `.stl`.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required Python packages before running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/convertto3d.git
   cd convertto3d

2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook convertto3d.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to:

3. Input a photo or a text prompt.
    Run the model.
    View/export the generated 3D model.
